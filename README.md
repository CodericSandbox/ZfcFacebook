Incredibly ropey prototype of a Facebook integration class.

 To use:

 1) Copy the SdFacebook to your module directory
 2) Register the module in your application's application.config.php
 3) Edit the module.config.php to have your Facebook app's App Id and Secret
 4) Tell your iframe app to point to www.yourdomain.com/facebook?a=b
 (You need the a=b because facebook is silly and doesn't allow you to end an url without a ? or /)
